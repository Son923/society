# Society Fail - Game Mechanics Document

## Core Game Philosophy

Society Fail is a post-apocalyptic incremental game focused on survival, community building, and confronting the mysterious force that caused civilization's collapse. The game should maintain a balance between active and idle mechanics, with a dark, mysterious atmosphere that gradually reveals a deeper narrative.

### The Three Ages of Gameplay

The game progresses through three distinct phases, each with unique mechanics and challenges:

#### Age 1: Survival (Days 1-30)
- **Focus**: Basic resource gathering, immediate survival needs
- **Key Systems**: Core resources (food, water, wood), basic party management
- **Atmosphere**: Desperate, uncertain, focused on day-to-day survival
- **Challenge Scale**: Local and immediate (hunger, thirst, shelter)

#### Age 2: Community (Days 31-100)
- **Focus**: Building a sustainable settlement, specialization, exploration
- **Key Systems**: Settlement building, technologies, expeditions, factions
- **Atmosphere**: Cautiously hopeful but discovering darker threats
- **Challenge Scale**: Regional (territory control, faction relations, The Darkness)

#### Age 3: Reclamation (Days 101+)
- **Focus**: Advanced technology, understanding The Darkness, legacy
- **Key Systems**: Advanced research, artifacts, corruption manipulation
- **Atmosphere**: Revelation, confrontation with the truth
- **Challenge Scale**: Global (confronting The Darkness, determining the future)

### Core Loops

1. **Short Loop (minutes)**: Gather resources → Manage party needs → Assign tasks
2. **Medium Loop (hours)**: Build structures → Research technology → Conduct expeditions
3. **Long Loop (days)**: Expand territory → Develop faction relations → Confront The Darkness
4. **Meta Loop (full playthrough)**: Complete a cycle → Reset with memory fragments → Start new cycle with bonuses

## Resource Systems

### Primary Resources (Tier 1)

| Resource | Gathering Method | Primary Use | Storage |
|----------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Food | Gather, Farm, Hunt | Party hunger, Crafting | Spoils over time |
| Water | Collect, Well | Party thirst, Farming | Limited base capacity |
| Wood | Chop, Lumber Mill | Buildings, Tools | Standard storage |

### Secondary Resources (Tier 2)

| Resource | Acquisition | Primary Use | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Knowledge Points | Research, Expeditions, Actions | Technology, Special abilities | Non-physical, doesn't spoil |
| Medicine | Crafting, Expeditions | Healing, Disease prevention | Crafted from herbs and food |
| Electricity | Power generators | Advanced buildings | Cannot be stored long-term |
| Scrap Metal | Expeditions, Ruins | Advanced tools, Buildings | Found in ruins and city expeditions |
| Fuel | Expeditions, Refining | Generators, Special equipment | Limited uses, high value |

### Advanced Resources (Tier 3)

| Resource | Acquisition | Primary Use | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Artifacts | Rare expedition finds | Unique abilities, Research | One-of-a-kind items with special powers |
| Corruption Essence | Darkness events, Rituals | Corruption manipulation, Dark technologies | Dangerous to accumulate |
| Memory Fragments | Cycle completion | Permanent upgrades | Meta-currency for prestige system |

### Resource Conversion

Resources should have conversion paths but with inefficiency to prevent trivial solutions:
- Food → Medicine (2:1 ratio)
- Wood → Fuel (3:1 ratio)
- Corruption → Knowledge (5:1 ratio, with risk)

### Resource Consumption Rates

Default consumption rates (per party member, per day):
- Food: 8 units
- Water: 6 units
- Wood (for heating/cooking): 2 units

These rates are affected by:
- Seasons (winter increases consumption)
- Technologies (efficiency upgrades reduce consumption)
- Party member traits (some consume more/less)
- Building types (better shelters reduce consumption)

## Party Member System

### Core Attributes

Each party member has the following attributes:
- Health (0-100): Physical wellbeing
- Hunger (0-100): Food satiation
- Thirst (0-100): Water satiation
- Energy (0-100): Action capacity
- Morale (0-100): Mental wellbeing
- Corruption (0-100): Influence of The Darkness

### Specializations

Party members can specialize in one of the following roles:

- Conversion inefficiencies prevent trivial solutions
- Multiple paths to acquire each resource type

### Risk vs. Reward
- Higher risk activities yield better rewards
- Safety mechanisms available at efficiency cost
- Emergency measures for critical situations
- Strategic sacrifice opportunities

### Meaningful Decisions
- Choices with both benefits and drawbacks
- Mutually exclusive options that define playstyle
- Long-term consequences for short-term decisions
- Hidden information requiring exploration to discover optimal strategies

### Pacing Guidelines
- Early game (days 1-10): 5-10 minutes real time
- Mid game (days 11-50): 1-2 hours real time
- Late game (days 51-100): 3-5 hours real time
- End game (days 100+): 5+ hours real time
- Full cycle completion: 8-12 hours for experienced players

### Scaling Formulas

**Resource Gathering Base Rates**:
- Food: 5 + (day / 10) per action
- Water: 4 + (day / 12) per action
- Wood: 3 + (day / 15) per action

**Resource Consumption Base Rates**:
- Food: 2 + (party_size * 0.8) per hour
- Water: 1.5 + (party_size * 0.6) per hour
- Wood: 1 + (party_size * 0.3) per hour

**Corruption Growth**:
- Base rate: 0.1 per hour
- Modified by: party_size * 0.02 + buildings * 0.01
- Seasonal modifiers: Winter (+25%), Summer (+10%), Fall (-10%), Spring (0%)

**Expedition Rewards**:
- Base resources: location_base * (1 + (day / 100))
- Special find chance: location_chance * (1 + (knowledge / 500))

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### State Management

The game state should be stored in a structured object:
```javascript
gameState = {
  // Core game state
  version: 5,
  day: 1,
  hour: 1,
  difficulty: "medium",
  
  // Resources
  resources: {
    food: 50,
    water: 50,
    wood: 50,
